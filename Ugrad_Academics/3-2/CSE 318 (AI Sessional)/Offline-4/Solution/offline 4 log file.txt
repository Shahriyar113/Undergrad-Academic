 The mine position remains same throughout the game

 2)When an user or AI makes a move (means clicking a cell) , if the cell contains a mine then "LOST" the game...if
 the cell does not contain a mine then " nearby count"(means koyta neighbouring cell a mine ase) for that cell is calculated and then
 "add_knowledge()" function of "MinesweeperAI" class is called.. This snippet of code is wriiten in the last if block(if move:) of 
 "runner.py" file
