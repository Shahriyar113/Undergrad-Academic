Follow this link to setup the Environment in a local Virtual Machine:

To copy content from your local machine to your cloud vm, use the following command:
scp -i <identity_file_location> <content_to_copy> username@public_ip:location

For example:
scp -i ./CSE-406_key.pem Necessary_docs.zip seed@20.235.240.157:/home/seed/CSE_406
scp -i ./CSE-406_key.pem 18_batch_online-A1.zip seed@20.235.240.157:/home/seed/CSE_406/18_batch


Note: You cannot directly copy the contents to the seed user. So later you need to move the content from /home/artushar/Downloads to /home/seed/Downloads or wherever you want to.


To connect cloud vm  using ssh:
ssh -i CSE-406_key.pem seed@20.235.240.157

vnc server:20.235.240.157:5901(FOR USING GUI)


To connect cloud vm using vnc client:
At first you need to move to the seed user. Then run the vncserver from the cloud vm. 
sudo su seed
vncserver -localhost no
At the first time, it will prompt to set up a password. Later you need to use the password to connect from the vncclient.
The first vncserver is set up at port 5901, and the second 5902, ....
So to connect the vm cloud from vncclient, you must give the accurate port number.
For example: 20.30.40.50:5901 and the provide the password
